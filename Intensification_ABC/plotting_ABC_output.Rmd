## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(d$PrDens)
hist(d$Raw)
i <- 1
model = sim.growthModel
spd.uncalsample.norm.param1 <- spd.uncalsample.norm

plot(spd.uncalsample.norm.param1$grid$PrDens ~ spd.uncalsample.norm.param1$grid$calBP, type = "l")
plot(spd.uncalsample.norm.param2$grid$PrDens ~ spd.uncalsample.norm.param2$grid$calBP, type = "l")


plot(d$PrDens ~ d$CRA, type = "l")
plot(d$Raw ~ d$CRA, type = "l")

plot(model$PrDens~model$CalBP, type = "l")

class(model)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
