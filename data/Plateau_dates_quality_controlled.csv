One of the pits was bell-shaped, expanding to twice its width. Fill contained flakes.  Altogether 2,007 artifacts were recovered from the fill, down to 5 cm above the floor.

Roof supported by 5 primary posts located around the hearth and 15 secondary posts along the interior wall of the structure. Flotation indicated that the roof was juniper posts and brush.

Floor produced numerous firecracked metate frags, which may represent 2 or more slab metates used in construction of floor features, including a hearth. Of significance is the 20+ pounds of burned adobe found in the feavure, some with log impressions, suggesting that the mud was used as chinking or support material in constructing the superstructure. The lack of postholes led the authors to suggest that the structure was cribbed, but this is highly speculative.","RADIOMETRIC",NA,"EULER AND STIGER 1981","Plateau",4398,90,"5GN204"

A 2-roomed structure with a small shallow room/entry area adjoining a larger, deeper house basin. The large house meas. 5 to 5.8 m in dia, and was excavated to a maximum depth of ca. 0.8 m below the estimated original surface. Steep walled with a sloping floor. The adjoining room is more nearly circular, with a diameter of 3.5 to 3.9 m; excavated no more than 0.25 m below the original ground surface. It is saucer shaped in profile. Floor features are almost exactly the same in the larger and smaller rooms. Both have 2 slab-lined storage cists, a shallow hearth, and a cluster of shallow floor depressions. The main room has an additional small slab-lined feature near the center, and the smaller room is nearly filled by these floor features.  Extra space exists around the N, W, and S perimeters of the larger basin room. No clear posthole pattern. Burned, stick impressed daub suggests mud plaster over a lattice. A thin clay lining may have been present on the floor, but this is not clear. House 1 fill: dark, organic, charcoal pieces, small pieces of basalt, numerous artifacts, faunal scrap, and some GS frags. Probably used as a trash dump during occupation of House 2. Slab-lined cists are extremely well chinked, and some of the slabs are metate and mano frags.",NA,NA,"Metcalf and Black, 1988, 1991; Faunmap 582","Plateau",6320,90,"Yarmony pithouse site"
